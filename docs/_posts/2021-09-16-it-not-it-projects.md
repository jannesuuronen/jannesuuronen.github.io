David Cotgreave wrote in an article published in the CIO about the effects of viewing IT projects as not IT projects. The news article does provide some interesting insights and conclusions that make for good reflective material. One significant outcome was that operationally/business-led initiatives with IT supporting the effort led to a higher level of engagement from the organization. This does ring a bell because it is more common nowadays to view IT as a given support structure within organizations rather than a separate department. However, it appears that there is still natural segmentation of IT projects and Non-IT projects.

It is sound that this division is causing more problems than gains. IT is still sometimes revered as being complex and intricate, thus tricky to comprehend by business-oriented staff. Not being able to understand goals and the context of initiatives naturally leads to decreased interested. Furthermore, some initiatives do depend on IT infrastructure or solutions to achieve their expected outputs. Thus, the line between business and IT is ever more diffuse, and it is counter-productive to segregate projects into disjoint types.
