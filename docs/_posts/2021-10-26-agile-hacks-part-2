Agile methods tend to enable faster value delivery compared to traditional namesakes. However, in some domains, agile practices don't fit inâ€”for example, areas with high coupling to an organisations bureaucracy. 

In these cases, situations that require rapid response and action might fall victim to the increased lead-time induced by processes. Amy C. Edmondson and Ranjay Gulati shed light on how we can counteract these situations by establishing temporary and agile teams, which operate outside the standard bureaucratic framework. These teams are created to achieve some goal in light of impairing time constraints. 

I like the approach proposed by the authors, and not only is this their re-telling of accounts. This is a method being applied in several prominent organisations. As much as processes and common business elements provide stability, traceability and a uniform approach. There are some cases where these complicate work, especially when time is of the essence. In those cases, we might need a team more rapid and flexible and with organisations support.
