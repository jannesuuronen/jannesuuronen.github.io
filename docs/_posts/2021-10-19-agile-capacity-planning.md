As opposed to capabilities, capacity refers to an organisations ability to perform work towards its objectives. Consequently, planning how much and when to employ resources is vital. 

In an Agile context, capacity planning refers to a team's bandwidth or how much work can be undertaken. Methods for quantifying bandwidth and current loads aim to put numbers on work tasks and make workload numerically manageable. Two standard measurement methods are Story Points and Hours, which we will discuss briefly. 
 
Story Points, as an estimate at first, sounds diffuse. However, its ability to estimate the difficulty of a task gives a good indication of the resources required to complete the item. On the other hand, hours can fulfil the same goal. In addition, there's no extra layer of complexity involved where story points need to be converted to hours to compare them with the project budget. So the question remains... is story points just a simplification to make workload estimation easier.
