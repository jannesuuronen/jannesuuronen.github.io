The hard-skills and soft-skills labelling of competence are familiar to most. We use hard skills to practice a profession, such as knowing a programming language or three-dimensional building models. Soft skills, otherwise known as "people skills", are our ability to communicate and teamwork. 

Alison Doyle wrote in a blog post back in 2020 on the differences between soft and hard skills. One remark she made in that post is referring to hard skills as "teachable". While there's truth in the statement itself, it implies a divide making soft skills "unteachable". Naturally, it is easier to prove that you master a hard skill via, for example, a course certificate. Arguably, the same can be said regarding soft skills. Some courses purposely intend to improve your soft skills. Implicitly labelling soft skills as unlearnable lacks sound reasoning. They may be harder to master and learn to harness, but they are definitively not unteachable. In the end, this might be the result of a poor categorization of skills in general.
