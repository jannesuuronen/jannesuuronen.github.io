In this post, we'll continue digesting the procedural aspects of digital transformation as described by Christian et al. This time, we'll look at leading digital transformation. 

It is suggested that the person operationally responsible for a transformation has sufficient experience from previous transformation initiatives and aligns themselves with strategic goals and progress. The exact role such a person holds is debated, and no concrete answer has been found. However, it is of importance that the same person continues to lead the transformation throughout its duration. 

From this description, we can draw some conclusions. It is evident that transformation is a sensitive process, and thus leadership needs to know what to do. They should also remain and see the transformation to its end, as it would otherwise impair the journey to reach the sought-after benefits.
