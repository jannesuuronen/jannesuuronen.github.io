While reading through an article suggested as interesting extra reading for the current course in the IT-PM program at SU, one part of the article caught my attention. The paper describes the relation and position of transformation strategies in the overall strategy landscape, and in this section, the paper outlines different strategy variants, such as operational and functional.  

Until this point, I haven't reflected too heavily on the topic of strategy other than it is a means for expressing the desired direction of an organisation. Naturally, having different kinds of strategies tailored for different purposes is very reasonable. The domain for which a strategy is applied ultimately determines how the strategy is realised. 

An exciting aspect to discuss is the integration of different strategies with each other. Naturally, strategies would logically be defined top-down as an organisation's overarching strategic goals ultimately determine what departments should prioritise.
