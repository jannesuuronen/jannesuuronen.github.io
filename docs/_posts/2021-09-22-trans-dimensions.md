This post will cover the two remaining dimensions of digital transformation strategies as described by M. Christian et al. Recall that there are four essential dimensions in total: 
- Use of technologies
- Changes in value creation
- Structural changes
- Financial aspects
We covered "use of technologies" and "structural changes" yesterday, and thus we are left with "Changes in value creation" and "Financial Aspects". 

Changes in value creation initially appear somewhat diffuse as a concept, in my opinion. Breaking it down tells a different story, however. Essentially, the dimensions seek to highlight the impact digital transformation has on an organisation's value chains, e.g. how an organisation generates value. The impact can be both negative and positive. Introducing new technologies as part of digital transformation can fuel the demand for new competence absent in the current organisation. 

When it comes to financial aspects, they play a significant role, and thus we should pay great attention to these. Ultimately, if the financial support isn't there for a transformation, it may very well be the end of it. Likewise, aside from being seen as a limitation, financial aspects can also be drivers for transformation.
