Good day! 

Welcome to the first post for my blog on topics related to Project Management in an Information Technology context. 

Some background about myself. I work as an Innovation Developer in Automation and Artificial Intelligence at Ericsson Business Area Managed Services. Before assuming this role, I was an Information Technology Trainee at the company mentioned above. Through the trainee program, I had the chance to experience various organisation units, realising the company's breadth and depth. I choose to pursue an opportunity with innovation as exploring and experimenting with different ideas hits close to home for me. 

Looking ahead into the future, I have the ambition to continue down the innovation track. However, I'm a person driven by assuming responsibility and eventually will want to grow the responsibility. This trait prompted me to gain an interest in project management and pursue studies within said area. That is where I am today and, as a result, the reason why this blog exists. 

On this blog, you'll be able to read reflections and comments on material digested throughout my study time. Initial topics will be strategies, benefits and alignment, with mediums being articles, academic literature and various other knowledge sources.

Thanks for stopping by! Until next time, take care!
