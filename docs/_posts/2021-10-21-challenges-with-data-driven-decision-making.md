In the previous post, we briefly and simplified data-driven decision-making. While we somewhat praised the method itself, we didn't go into potential challenges with being data-driven. 

For the two upcoming posts, we will cover some of the challenges. 

The first is relatively straightforward, the lack of adequate infrastructure and tools. One pre-requisite for making data-driven decisions is to have data to base your reasoning on, which means collecting it structurally. Without this infrastructure, it isn't easy to progress any further. Likewise, if you can't analyse and visualise the data, the data itself isn't worth much. 

The second one is related to the first. Getting ahold and analysing the data is one part of the job. However, this part of the job may be fruitless if the quality of the information is poor. Any insights and conclusions drawn can be false and misguiding leading to incorrect decisions, which may cause further implications and consequences for the organisation.
