Rounding off this week's posts, and the trilogy of posts covering seven good-to-know aspects for PMs, is an entry focusing on the skills needed to be a successful digital leader, as suggested by the CIO in an interview they conducted with several Chief Information Officers.

In particular, being a leader for comprehensive organizations puts significant pressure on having an adequate skill set that allows you to live up to expectations. The CIO's interview suggests that the following skills are needed to be successful in a digital leadership role: 
1. Adaptability
2. Capable of navigating uncertainty
3. Adept at building relationships
4. Excellent communication
5. Empathy
6. Capable of cultivating a culture of collaboration
7. Compelling storytelling

Some of the skills sound logical, such as being adaptive and navigating the points of uncertainty. The risks of being too rigid and having a fixed mindset are well-known, and it is pretty straightforward: if you don't adapt to change, change won't adapt to you. 

Building and cultivating relationships is arguably highly important. Connections and making them last can go a long way, given that trust is an essential aspect of transformation if it is to be successful. Moreover, it is important to be empathic and show understanding of everyone's position. Most can say that they all have experienced the frustration of someone's unwillingness to understand their perspective. Empathy ties nicely into the need of being capable of growing and maintaining a collaborative culture. 

Finally, endeavours are often journeys or part of journeys and sharing these are equally as important as doing them. It is through emotion and sympathy that you gather people and create common goals. Naturally, this also demands good communication skills since conveying the story in a complex manner may very well turn a good story terrible.
