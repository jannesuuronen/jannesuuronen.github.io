In the past and current week, my studies have been focused on Benefits Realization Management or BRM for short. BRM is a framework for managing planned benefits, and its lifecycle consists of three stages: Identify, Execute and Sustain. 

The Identify stage focuses on selecting which benefits to pursue and which type of endeavour is suitable for achieving said benefits. In the Execute stage, initiatives are completed and outputs produced. Finally, the benefits owners realize the planned benefits. 

Just looking at these three stages and how they define BRM shows they provide substantial value whenever implemented correctly. It makes a lot of sense to utilize BRM since it reduces the risk for unrealized benefits. Moreover, it ensures that initiatives from the start have concise expected benefits, contributing to effective resource utilization.
