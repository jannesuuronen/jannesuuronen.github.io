Previously, we've covered agile takes on some well-known concepts, such as project portfolio management. 

However, one area's take on agility that we haven't covered is change management. Change management is the collection of methods and processes with which one brings about organisational change.

Sarah Jensen Clayton sheds some light on an agile take on change management in an article published in the Harvard Business Review(HBR). More specifically, the article targets crisis-driven change, but we'll try to discuss the insights generally.  

One aspect that Clayton highlight is declaring your change vision. This is all about setting and communicating a direction to your organisation. When the crisis hits, you may need to act fast, and in doing so, it is ever so important to have a clear picture of where you want to send the organisation. As Clayton mentions, the vision will not be perfect, and not all stakeholders will get their chance to have a say. However, it is better to have a clear feeling rather than nothing to avoid juggling back and forth with stakeholders. 

Another important that Clayton mentions is empowering self-organised teams to complement the organisation-wide initiatives. It is enjoyable that this, in particular, is mentioned since it harnesses the strength of people's motivation and drives. Of course, this must be executed correctly. Having too many initiatives spiralling out of control may cause more damage than benefits. Self-organising teams are a substantial part of the agile ways of working. Seeing that we can translate it into a change management domain is a valuable perspective that definitively shouldn't be kept in the backseat.
