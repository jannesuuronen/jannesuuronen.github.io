During the past two weeks, the course has focused on portfolios and portfolio management. Given that we're focusing on IT portfolio management, it would be interesting to look closer at how it changes when sub-components employ agile methods, such as scrum and kanban.

Henrico Dolfing published a series of articles on this exact topic. His view on the constellation is that the choice of the delivery method makes little impact on the management of portfolios. In the end, projects and programs are still projects and programs regardless of their delivery method. 

I do find H. Dolfing has a good point. Portfolio management ultimately concerns itself with initiatives' outcomes, thus making the method with which these outcomes are achieved less influential. With that said, Dofling does highlight the processes involved in portfolio management is somewhat different. We'll be going over the exact differences in the upcoming posts.
