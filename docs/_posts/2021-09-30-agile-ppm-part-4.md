This post continues our reflections on the article series by Henrico Dolfing covering Agile Project Portfolio Management(APPM). 

In the previous post, we discussed the concept of a Portfolio Backlog, which holds all our ongoing and selected projects. Thus further contributing to organising our portfolio in an agile manner. Furthermore, the role of the Portfolio Owner has been mentioned several times, without any deeper exploration into its responsibilities and tasks. 

The Portfolio Owner is responsible for managing a portfolio and thus fulfils a vital position. The person holding this role is solely responsible for the Project and Portfolio Backlog. Therefore, the owner is essential in ordering the backlogs items and ensuring they are formulated. To support the owner, it can have a Portfolio Team, but the owner remains solely accountable. 

At first glance, the responsibilities of the Portfolio Owner are many, thus raising the question of all can be met by one person only. There are only so many person-hours one person can deliver. Instead, it might be a fact that the Portfolio Owner requires a team to meet all expectations. On the other hand, having one person responsible for most of the collective responsibilities can induce quick decision making. Naturally, this depends on the characteristics of the owner at hand. Moreover, one person making all the decisions can be seen as naive since one person's incentives might occlude the broader perspective.
