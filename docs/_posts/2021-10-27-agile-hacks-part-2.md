In the previous post, we covered the employment of temporary agile teams as a response to sudden time-constrained situations. We'll continue to discuss this concept further in this post. 

One thought that came into mind during the writing of the last post is, at first glance, the chaotic ways of working such teams employ. However, Edmondson and Gulati stress that so is not the case. The units used a systematic process of trial and error. So amid the chaos, there is structure and systematics. Their study shows that processes were designed to create a higher learning pace and force progress. The result is a method dubbed "execution as learning", a structured approach to completing projects while following a trial-and-error approach. 

Arguably, this addresses the concern of a lacking structured way of working when employing this kind of team. Conclusively, there is great potential in creating these kinds of specialised "command squads". And it does make sense that we must act swiftly in some situations, and processes may do more harm than benefit. Then we can resort to the baseline framework of trial and error to maintain a structure.
