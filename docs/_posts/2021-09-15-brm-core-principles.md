The past two weeks have focused on Benefits Realization Management(BRM). The framework guides us on how we can reap our planned benefits from the initiatives' start to conclusion and moving forwards, ultimately sustaining those benefits. 

There are five core principles of BRM, and since it is beneficial to repeat the fundamentals regularly, I figure we would try and comment on them a little bit. 
- Net Benefits Justify The Use of Invested Resources
- Commencement of Work is Driven By Benefits Identification
- Planned Benefits are Identified in Authorizing Documents
- Benefits Realization is Holistically Planned and Managed
- Governance and Adequate Resources are Essential to BRM Success
It is apparent that BRM is a holistic framework since the core principles provide an over grasping structure. BRM does not limit its relevance to portfolios, programs and projects, but instead concerns organizations in their entirety. It is highly reasonable since benefits, in the end, tie into strategic objectives and without a method for creating and facilitating this connection, it is challenging to ensure benefits are correct and achieved. 

Through support in governance and processes, BRM aims at creating assurance that the correct endeavours are commenced and that their benefits have a strategic purpose. Thus, initiatives also can enjoy better support and engagement from sponsors, which are typically more involved in strategic aspects.
