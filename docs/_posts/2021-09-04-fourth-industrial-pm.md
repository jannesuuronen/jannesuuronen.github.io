The International Project Management Association posted an article on Industry 4.0's impact on the project management role in 2017, showing that the advance of the fourth industrial revolution and the change it brings about has been discussed quite early. 

I felt one sentence of the article was somewhat provocative and can be interesting to discuss. 

> Project management must respond more and more quickly and operate more proactively in the digital world.

There are several implications to this statement. Firstly, it suggests that project managers are expected to act more quickly compared to before. Naturally, this is enabled by the introduction of numerous digital tools that simplify a PM's tasks. However, worth pointing out is that speed may end up competing with the quality. As well as increase the amount of stress induced by the role of PM. 

Secondly, it is expected that PM's actively examine and search for data of importance to a project. For example, data that could impact the direction(e.g. an enterprise environmental factor) or data vital for risk prevention and mitigation. Data is only one aspect, whilst it plays a large part in decision making. Being proactive can mean several different things. For example, thanks to instant communication channels, respond and reach out to persons faster and easier. 

Finally, it appears as if PM's are expected to be more present and responsive, which does sound reasonable to some extent. In geographically distributed teams, this aspect is challenging to manage since PM's can't be available at all times. Suppose a PM decides to be present more hours of the day to compensate for different time zones. There can be consequences such as excessive overtime, burn-outs and impacts on private life.
