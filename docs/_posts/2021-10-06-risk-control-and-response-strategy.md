When reading up on crucial planning elements in Portfolio Risk Management, in the "Standard for Portfolio Management", I read a phrase stating: "At the portfolio level, risks are not controlled, they are managed within a comprehensive risk strategy". I find it interesting that the literature makes such a distinction. At first glance, managing risk via a strategy and controlling the risk both sound indifferent, at least for the common ear. 

However, they are, in fact, not indifferent. Controlling a risk involves implementing operational processes such that the risks are mitigated. Managing risk via strategy instead refers to applying an approach that affects risks in a specified manner. Examples of risk strategies are "Risk Avoidance", "Risk Mitigation", and "Risk Transference". For clarity, the difference is that risk response strategies aim at affecting risks in a specific way. In contrast, risk control aims at solely mitigating risks via the implementation of procedural routines.
