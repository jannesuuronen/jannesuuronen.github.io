In the previous post, we covered a non-numeric project selection method dubbed "Sacred Cow", where a senior executive order an initiative based on their experience, level of authority and judgment. I would consider this method somewhat extreme as it virtually lacks any data foundation for decision-making and relies on soft skills. 

On the other side of the spectrum, we find mathematical models for project selection. Before going into further details, there is already a clear advantage being highlighted. Mathematical models are naturally objectives as they merely follow the rules set by their definition. Of course, this also raises a question surrounding accountability. Who's is to be held accountable for a decision made based on a model's output. With that said, a decision-maker naturally made the active decision to trust a model, so accountability is exercised thereby. If we go back to the original discussion point, entrusting selection to a mathematically somehow feels secure and financially reasonable. Data-based decision making is frequently used to reduce the bias and subjectiveness of decision-makers. Employing mathematical models is a step in the same direction but without the decision-makers subjective take on the resulting data analysis.
