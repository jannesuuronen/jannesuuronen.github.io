Today's post will further examine the contents of M. Christian et al.'s article on digital transformation strategies. More specifically, we'll look at what they dub the four essential dimensions of digital transformation strategies. 
- Use of technologies
- Changes in value creation
- Structural changes
- Financial aspects
The exact implementation and look of these aspects naturally differ between cases. I want to go over two of these four dimensions in this post, the use of technology and structural changes. 

Technology plays a significant role in digital transformation since the intended effect may rely on successful technical implementation, e.g., introducing the infrastructure and tools needed to achieve the desired benefit. 

Aside from technology, ensuring business support for the transformation is equally important, and if we reflect back on Benefits Realization Management and the need for proper structural support. We can see a similarity to digital transformation. If we don't have the organizational structure needed to sustain the benefit coming from the digital transformation project, then the benefit will be short-lived.
