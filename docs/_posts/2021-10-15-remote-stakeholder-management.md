Remote working is common nowadays due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, which closed down most offices. While an increased distance from each other is vital for everyone's health, it does come with its challenges. Previously, a project manager would sometimes be present physically for stakeholder meetings. Offices are becoming more and more occupied now, but some are not. How has working remotely impacted stakeholder management? 

Mihaela Draghici wrote an article on remote stakeholder management in April of 2020, just as the pandemic began. Let's discuss a couple of the points she covered. 

"Keep stakeholders updated remotely." 
We often say that we miss the "coffee machine"-conversations, which can act as a natural channel for updating stakeholders. With these absent, we need to put extra effort into updating our stakeholders and how we share updates. Just as quickly, we may forget about a stakeholder because we physically don't see them anymore. 

"Make sure the info you provide is straightforward to understand."
Engaging in face-to-face conversations provides substantially more value to a conversation via, for example, body language and facial expression. It is also easier to interpret how the receiver of a communication responds to the message. With calls and textual being the primary communication mediums, it is ever more important to be clear in what you're trying to communicate. A block of text can be interpreted in many ways depending on the kind of person reading it. So the communication might need to be adapted to suit the receiver for it to be as straightforward as possible.
