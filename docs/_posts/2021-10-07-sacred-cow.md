One of the suggested readings from last week covers project selections methods. There are several categories, such as non-numerical, numerical and scoring-based methods. The applicability of these methods naturally differs from case to case. Still, an interesting remark regarding non-numerical methods is that some rely on decision-makers ability to judge situations correctly. 

One method, in particular, that is worthwhile discussing is the "Sacred Cow", where senior management staff essentially orders the embarking of an endeavour based on the experience and authority provided by their position. First of all, it is interesting that this is a recognized method. Yes, of course, high-level executives will be ordering initiatives based on their experience and understanding; however, as PMI's article on selection methods states. The implications of applying such a method provide ample room for questioning the decision. Personally, when thinking about it, I almost find it provocative to have a manager select an initiative based on what's essentially describing their gut feeling.
