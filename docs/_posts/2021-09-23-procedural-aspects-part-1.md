We are wrapping up this week's posts digesting the article by Christian et al. by looking at their view on what they call "procedural aspects of digital transformation". 

In addition to the four dimensions of digital transformation covered in previous posts, there's a need to consider some other more specific aspects. I find that Christian et al. highlight these points very well since they may be commonly overlooked. Let us go over some of these in our upcoming articles. 

A digital transformation strategy needs to be embraced full-heartedly, or the embarking organisation may otherwise face difficulties. This is highly reasonable since a transformation can be pretty encompassing, and if there's a lack of engagement towards the change, there might be severe consequences. Imagine an organisation transitioning to a new order management system that radically changes its ordering and supply processes. If the transition to the new system lost its fuel and engagement halfway through its timeline, the consequences would be a substantial waste of resources, and in the worst case, semi-functional order management systems. Naturally, this could affect the core business, an organisation's most valuable income stream. Thus costing the company a lot monetarily and brand reputation.
