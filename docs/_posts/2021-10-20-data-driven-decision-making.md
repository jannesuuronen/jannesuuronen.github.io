Data-driven decision making is a method for decision-makers to make calls based on organizational and business metrics, numbers and data. However, at an initial glance, it might be diffuse what being data-driven means in practice. 

Kelsey Miller wrote up an introduction to data-driven decision making. Simplified, being data-driven means collecting data, identifying patterns and insights, and using these in your decision-making process instead of relying on intuition and observations alone. 

One reflection that may pop up is, "Shouldn't this be given?" as in isn't it evident that we should make decisions suit the current situation.  However, as much as it would hurt to admit. A lot of decisions are made based on empirical observations. The approach is naturally sometimes viable and not a bad option itself, as decisions sometimes need to be made fastly. However, it shouldn't be the de facto decision-making method as there's the picture usually is more extensive than what can be perceived by the naked eye.
