A guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge, PMBOK Guide, is one of the books on the literature list in my current course on Strategies, Benefit and Alignment. 

One section of the book that captured my interest is the one covering project business cases. A business case should cover the following bullets: 
- Business needs; explaining the need for the project, the intended value, and which stakeholders are concerned by the project. 
- Analysis of the situation; the project's goals and objectives, risks, success factors and root causes.
- The recommended option for the project. 
- Evaluation; how the benefits are measured.

This presentation of a typical business case sparks my interest because my experience with the concept is quite deviating. From interactions with my colleagues, a business case only accounts for initial financial estimates for innovation activities. These estimates are often used as an argument for why decision-makers should give an activity the go-ahead. So while a business case by this definition fulfils a similar purpose as the one defined by the PMBOK Guide, there's an excessive focus on numbers before other aspects. There are definitively downsides to this approach since much information goes unmentioned. However, it provides an objective and impact-driven decision since numbers indicate both cost and the expected benefits. However, the breadth of benefits is narrowed down to the only financial gains.
