A capability is something that a business practices and does. Not to be mixed with competencies and people-related skills, a capability also encompasses processes and other things surrounding it. 

Capability-based planning is a method consisting of a collection of techniques that organisations can leverage to: 
Identify its capabilities
Assess what changes need to be done to each capability
Prioritise the changes
Make a plan introducing and implementing the changes

Chuen Seet describes the pros of using capabilities-based planning in his article at Jibility.com. Some of the advantages mentioned are interesting points for discussion. Arguably, the most significant advantage of viewing things from a capabilities-based perspective is its focus on what the business is doing. We work towards fulfilling our goals, and enhancing our "doing" consequently improves our "doing", making it more effective. In the process, we also learn more about what the business is doing, thus assisting us in our alignment processes.
