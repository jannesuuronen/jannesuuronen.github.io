This week's lecture focused on value and benefits and how we manage benefits. 

One section of the lecture described the connection between value and benefits and how they fit into the big picture. The diagram below illustrates the relationships in a simple manner.

Since a long time back, it is my firm belief that it is essential to realize how things intertwine with each other to make better decisions, whether it is business, design or implementation related. The diagram showcases the importance of just that, having a holistic view of how everything is connected. 

A company strategy is essential and defines the company's desired direction. The objectives, in turn, determine the concrete goals that need to be met through initiatives. From these initiatives, outputs and outcomes are procured, and finally, we derive benefits and value from these initiatives that contribute to realizing our strategy. 

Working as a developer, not too often, I find myself only knowing so much about the position of a project in the company landscape. Learning about what and where the project's outcomes end up will ultimately improve the quality of my work, as I can better understand what value is going to be realized.
