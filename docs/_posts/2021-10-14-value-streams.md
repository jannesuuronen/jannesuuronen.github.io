Portfolio Management, as outlined in the "Standard for Portfolio Management", is one option for how an actor can manage their initiatives. 

Another approach is to organise a portfolio to consist of value streams, through which the organisation delivers solutions that contribute to the fulfilment of strategic objectives. 

Value streams come in two different forms, 1) Operational Value Streams and 2) Development Value Streams. The former concerns the steps needed to deliver a service or product to a customer, while the latter refers to the development of services and products that customers consume. It is within the last that we often find IT professionals. 

Organising a team as part of a value stream may sound reasonably intuitively. Compared to the agile ways of working, there are many similarities. In essence, value streams are merely one way of organising value delivery in an agile and lean manner.
