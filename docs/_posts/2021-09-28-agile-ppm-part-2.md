This post continues our reflections on the article series by Henrico Dolfing covering Agile Project Portfolio Management(APPM). 

A common component of agile project management is the product backlog. The backlog consists of actionable to-do items, such as a new feature or a bug fix for software.

Dolfing argues that we can apply this concept to project portfolio management, effectively creating a Project Backlog overall portfolio projects. The upfront benefits would be that projects organically grow and thus change the Project Backlog as understanding is improved. The Project Backlog is ordered according to priority to create a structure, and thus priority would naturally change as we learn more about the initiatives. 

I do find that this approach comes with its benefits but also its weaknesses. The arguably most beneficial aspect of agile methods is shorter value creation time compared to traditional alternatives. So, APPM can lead to faster value creation from sub-components. However, agile methods tend to advocate more independence, alignment and monitoring can be more difficult. This can affect the success of projects in terms of benefits, as poor alignment can result in misaligned benefits.
