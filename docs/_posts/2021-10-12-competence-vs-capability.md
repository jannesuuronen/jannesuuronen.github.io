The terms competency and capabilities are often used interleaved, and thus some may be under the impression that they are synonymous. However, some key differences set the two terms apart. 

Kul Bhusan Saxena wrote on the difference between competence and capabilities in a LinkedIn article back in 2014. 

He defines competence as: "a firm's capacity to deploy its resources using processes to affect a desired end." and capability as "the use and deployment of its competencies to accomplish its organizational goals.". 

We can draw some conclusions and reflections from these definitions. Firstly, competency is a prerequisite for an organization to possess a capability. Secondly, competence refers to the capacity and the usage of an actor's resources to reach the desired effect. Thirdly, capability refers to the organization's ability to use its competencies to achieve goals. The differences are somewhat diffuse, but there's more than enough reason to be mindful about your word choice in some contexts.
