For this final post, we will be going into some common avoidable mistakes made by project managers. For someone new to the project management domain, there's still a lot to learn. Practically it is thus reasonable to go over some of the mistakes that others have made and learn from them. 

Santiago Bibiloni covers seven mistakes and how to avoid them in his article published on Medium. Two of which are micromanagement and too broad scope. 

Micromanagement speaks for itself. It is the notion of managing every event and detail of a project, including team member tasks and their execution. This is one of the practices most efficient at demoralising teams, creating distrust and hampering innovation. However, with that said. I think this is where most new project managers end up at least once. It takes experience to trust others to perform their assigned tasks, and the pressure of being accountable for the team's performance drives leaders to adopt an "I'll just do it myself mindset".  

Realising that a project's scope is too broad is difficult. Yet again, this becomes easier with experience, but greenhorns most likely end up in this situation at some point. What's important to remember is being able to say no to stakeholders. Otherwise, the scope may just as well continue to grow due to out-of-control demands. However, identifying what's too much and not is in itself a challenge. In such cases, the team is a vital support. It is impossible to possess all the knowledge needed to scope a project. Going back to the challenge of micromanagement, trust in your team and its capabilities is a must.
