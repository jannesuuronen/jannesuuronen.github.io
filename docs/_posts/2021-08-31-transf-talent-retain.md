We discussed the transformation of the project management role in the previous post. That topic being narrow, it can be interesting to reflect on a more distant perspective, digitization of society and its impacts. 

The World Economic Forum cover three key areas that they believe will be impacted by the increasing digitization of society. 1) Employment and skills, 2) Environmental sustainability and 3) Trust. The first aspect is highly relevant within IT since the pace of transformation is very high compared to other areas. 

For every job phased out by technologies such as automation, three to four new jobs appear. WEF's article states that the distribution of these new jobs will differ from industry to industry, where some industries may end up marginalized. The situation raises some interesting points of discussion and insights into how and why employers tackle this challenge. With transformation occurring at an ever-faster rate, ensuring talent retainment is vital. Thus it is a sound decision to make people skilling a continuous strategic priority. This also signals the responsibility businesses have in providing their talent with the means of keeping themselves relevant. It is safe to claim that companies that don't adopt a modern talent retainment strategy will ultimately struggle with staffing shortages. The portion of new individuals joining the workforce is minimal compared to the active correspondency. Thus it is not feasible to rely on new talent only whenever transformation actualizes new demands. 

Conclusively, the digitization of society puts demands on businesses to modernize and employ a talent retainment strategy that focuses on re- and upskilling of talent. The IT industry is especially susceptible to skills being declared irrelevant, and thus the question should be the centre of attention in each company's peoples strategy.
