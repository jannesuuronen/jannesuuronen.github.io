We have covered various segments of Benefits Realization Management(BRM) in previous posts. This post will cover the circumstances needed to be met for BRM to work efficiently and succeed. 

Initially, let's cover the definition of a Critical Success Enabler(CSE) in the context of BRM. CSEs are organisational capabilities intended to better BRM performance by stimulating several different factors concerned in BRM. The scope ranges from inspiring leaders to be clear when defining benefits to preparing the harnessing outcomes to realise benefits. 

PMI's practical guide to BRM defines the following CSEs: 
Establish Clear BRM Roles and Responsibilities
Develop the Right BRM Culture
Build the Right Skill Sets
Embrace Flexibility
Strengthen Governance and Risk Management
Establish Benefits Tracking
At first glance, one can argue that these CSEs are self-explanatory and to some obvious factors to consider. Whenever adopting or using an organisational framework, clarity in roles and which responsibilities these include is vital. Consider yourself in a position where you need to operate according to a framework without knowing how to act and use it. Naturally, you would be underperforming, at least until you've gotten the hang of things. Still, without clear guidelines, you may follow the framework incorrectly, thus resulting in unforeseen negative consequences for the organisation. This fact further emphasises the need for appropriate skillsets. 

However, even if there is clarity in roles responsibilities and we possess the correct skillset, we may still underutilise the framework due to poor culture. Recall that BRM targets the entire organisation, and thus we need to have a culture that encourages and embraces it. Speaking of welcoming, the fact that BRM highlights a positive mindset towards change is critical. Change is a fact, and it will happen unexpectedly, so preparedness dramatically improves the odds for repositioning yourself and capturing benefits. 

Finally, let's cover the fact that tracking is needed. This boils down to a simple fact if we don't know what is happening, how can we act appropriately. The information and the timely relevance of said information enable us to make the best decisions and utilise our resources for increased efficiency.
