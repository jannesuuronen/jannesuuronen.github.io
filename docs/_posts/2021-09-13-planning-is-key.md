Several components make up a project, resources, stakeholders, documents etc. Proper planning can thus make or break a project. The consequences of poor project planning can be vast. 

Moira Alexender wrote an article published in the CIO on the potential negative side-effects of inadequate planning, highlighting the importance of dedicating time to planning activities. 
- Lack of strategic alignment
- Cost, quality and time constraint issues and scope creep
- Inefficient use of resources
- Communication Issues
- Increased Risk
These side-effects speak for themselves in their severity. Holistically, there is no doubt that planning affects almost every part of a project. Starting from not being aligned strategically can determine how successful your project is in terms of achieved benefits. Thus resources may end up being wasted. Likewise, if not appropriately planned, how do we know how and when to utilize and deploy our resources. It speaks for itself that hiring a consultant when not needed will be costly for little gain.

Cost, quality, and time are factors constantly scrutinized. Not paying attention to these when planning your endeavour can have you miss out on influencing factors and their impact on your project. Moreover, not regulating and see how the metrics change over time can result in over- or under usage. 

Finally, not planning how to communicate is also a naturally dangerous approach to take. If stakeholders and other involved partners find a lack of transparency, they may reduce their engagement, negatively impacting the project. All in all, these ignoring these factors in planning induces higher risks and thus making the endeavour less worthwhile in exchange for the intended benefit.
