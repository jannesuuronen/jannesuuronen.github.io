This post continues our reflections on the article series by Henrico Dolfing covering Agile Project Portfolio Management(APPM). 

In the previous post, we discussed the concept of a Project Backlog, which holds all our projects and projects proposals. The Project Backlog enables us to structure our portfolio of projects in an agile fashion. 

Another key agile concept is sprint backlogs that provide us with an idea of a project's ongoing and planned work. The concept can be translated to the portfolio management domain, according to Dolfing, birthing a structure dubbed the Portfolio Backlog. This backlog contains our executing and selected projects, thus making it an output of our selection and alignment process. The projects themselves are ordered according to priorities determined by an evaluation process. Like with the Project Backlog, the Portfolio Backlog is owned by the Portfolio Owner. 

The notion of using a Portfolio Backlog does lean towards a more flexible method of managing project portfolios. Something worth pointing out, however, is the absence of programs. As programs are collections of projects and APPM is heavily focused on projects, there is no natural space for programs to exist within a portfolio. Hence it is assumed that a project is either able to deliver the same value as a program. Dolfing does not address this question, but his reasoning suggests that APPM eliminates the concept of programs for the sake of flexibility and simplicity. If this is an advantage or disadvantage is hard to tell.
