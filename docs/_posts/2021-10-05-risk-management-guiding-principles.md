This post continues to touch on the topic of portfolio risk management. More specifically, we'll look at some of the guiding principles. 

The Standard for Portfolio Management lists a set of seven core principles for Project Portfolio Management. In addition to these, the standard also mentions three principles central to risk management. 

1) Maximize portfolio value while balancing risks
2) Foster a culture that embraces change and risk
3) Navigate complexity to enable successful outcomes 

I find that the second principle is quite interesting. It again highlights the importance of a culture, which is positive to change and encourages courageous decisions. Change is a fact, and if we don't embrace it, there will be costly consequences. Naturally, we should try and minimize risks. At the same time, we don't dare to face certain risks development growth may stagnate. This effect is equally risky behaviour as innovation is choked, and we might lose our competitive advantage and negatively impact our core business.
