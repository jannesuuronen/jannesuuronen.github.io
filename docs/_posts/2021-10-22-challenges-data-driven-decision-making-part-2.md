n the last post, we touched on two challenges to consider when employing data-driven decision-making. With this post, we'll round out this discussion by looking at two additional challenges. 

The two previous challenges we listed were the lacking ability to collect data and the quality of the data. However, these two aside, we might also struggle with data-driven decision-making if we don't know how to use our data. This challenge is fundamentally something that can make or break the principle of data-driven decision-making. 

Finally, a significant component of data-driven decision-making is in its name, e.g. data. However, it is crucial to remember not to be overly reliant on your data. Sometimes, a human aspect is needed in a decision to achieve the best possible outcome. Hence, the best would be to balance data interpretation and human empirical thinking and observation.
