This post wraps up our reflections on the article series by Henrico Dolfing covering Agile Project Portfolio Management(APPM). 

In this post, we're looking closer at the central governing body of APPM. We covered the role and responsibilities of the Portfolio Owner lastly. This time around, we'll discuss the Portfolio Committee. 

The purpose and responsibility are to govern the portfolios with the help of the Portfolio Owner's input. The committee consists of persons with adequate organisational authority and experience to facilitate the alignment of portfolio sub-components with strategies. Recommendations shared by the committee may be suspension, changing and resource re-allocation between sub-components. Decisions, as mention previous, are made in conjunction with Portfolio reviews. 

The need for a governing body speaks for itself in many ways. The risk of having one person, e.g. the Portfolio Owner, being the sole decision-maker is evident. When it comes to what makes the Portfolio Committee agile in comparison to other forms of governing bodies is unclear. Governing bodies uphold similar responsibilities regardless of their operating model, except for the various structures they govern, e.g. Portfolio Backlogs or Portfolio Management Plans.
