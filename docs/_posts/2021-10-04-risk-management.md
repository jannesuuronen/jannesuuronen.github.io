When we hear "risk, " we often interpret the term as a potential negative consequence, outcome or threat. Risk management is the process of identifying, assessing and controlling risks. These may originate from a sea of different sources, and thus to avoid falling victim to these risks, we must work proactively. 

I read through the chapter on "Risk Management" in PMI's "The Standard for Portfolio Management". I was surprised that risk management in the portfolio management context has a positive interpretation of the above definition. Risk also covers opportunities, which at initial thought is in stark contrast to its otherwise standard definition. 

The choice of including opportunities as part of risk management is a logical grouping and, at the same time, not. One aspect that speaks for the categorization is that opportunities essentially are negated risks. Thus it is reasonable to manage them collectively to gain a broader perspective. At the same time, the two can be vastly different in format. Consequently, there is a need for more comprehensive competence in the person/team responsible for managing risks.
