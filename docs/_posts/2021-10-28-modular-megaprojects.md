The notion of a project is something we're familiar with by now. It is a time-bound initiative created to produce a specific result. The scope and scale of projects differ from case to case as results require different resources and competence. One particular class of projects with an extensive scope is megaprojects, e.g. civil infrastructure and building a new factory. 

Megaprojects can span several decades, and their budget can go up the billions(imagine dollars/SEK). Given the scope, these kinds of projects come with their set of costly challenges. Not only that, but the amount of time before the value is generated is distant. 

Bent Flyvbjerg did a piece for the Harvard Business Review on making megaprojects more modular as a means of early value generation. One example mentioned is the Tesla Motors Gigafactory in Nevada, US. The project's goal was to piece by piece build up the factory, thus modularly increasing its efficiency. Consequently, the project generated value early even though it was far from finished. 

The modular take on megaprojects is familiar for someone coming from the IT and Software development industry. It embodies the purpose of agility in such a way that it simply makes sense. With that said, yes, it most likely might be challenging to modularise some megaprojects. However, it doesn't make it infeasible. Imagine, for example, an infrastructure project where a new highway is to be constructed. Instead of completing the entire highway before opening it for traffic, it would make sense to open it for limited capacity and thus facilitate earlier value generation.
